# List of algorithms failed to execute

Below we provide a list of algorithms that we were unsuccessful to run. Each column gives the following information:

- **ID**: Identifier for the algorithm in the central list of algorithms
- **Name**: Name of the algorithm
- **Error Type**: Type of error incurred when trying to run the algorithm
- **Detail**: Detailed description of the error
- **Has doc.?**: Whether the algorithm had documentation/guide for running it. (`X` is No, and `O` is Yes)

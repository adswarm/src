## Evaluation of the Fixes

### 1. Normalized Overhead

After applying each fix and the integrated fix (all fixes combined), we measure 
whether the patched algorithms take longer to achieve the
original missions. Since the fixed swarm algorithms become
more robust, it is expected to have a certain overhead. 

We observe 3.9%, 2.5%, 1.2%, and 1.5% average overhead for
A1, A2, A3, and A4, respectively. 

For the integrated fix, we find that a fix with the most overhead mostly determines the
overhead: 11.4%, 9.0%, 2.2%, and 4.7% average overhead for
A1, A2, A3, and A4, respectively.

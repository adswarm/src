# Overview

For "SwarmFlawFinder: Discovering and Exploiting Logic Flaws of Swarm Algorithms", we publicly release all tools, data, and results in this reposity. This repository is cited
in Section 1 (Introduction) of the paper for readers to find. For all data, tools, and result, please refer XXX folder. 

Moreover, we aid in visualizing the different attack strategies mentioned in Section 4 (Design). The visualizations can be found in XXX folder. For the multiple drones scenario mentioned in the same section of the paper, we discuss it and visualize it here and can be found in XXX folder. 

Later in Section 5, for better evaluations of fixes we measure the quality and performance of our fixes. We add the detailed evaluation result of the fixes here and can be found in XXX folder. In section 5, we also evaluate the spatial distribution of the test cases and show it for A1 in paper. The spatial distribution of the remaining algorithms (A2, A3, and A4) can be found in this XXX folder. 

In appendix we discuss the not executable algorithms and briefly discuss about them. To give a more detailed breakdown, we list errors and information about the errors for each algorithm in this XXX folder. And, for further elaboration for the discussion of algorithms that lack swarm behavior, we put the content in XXX folder. As for the results of the remaining algorithms (A2 and A3) for the impact of fixes and integrated fixes can be found in XXX folder. Finally for the details of supporting additional algorithms can be found in XXX folder.

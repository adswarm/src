# Tools used for the project

This page contains code used in the paper including prototype, tools, data and fixes.

## Prototype

Prototype folder include the prototype of ADSWARM using A1.
(A2,A3, and A4 will be released after the paper review process.)

## Tools

This folder has tools what we used for preprocessing, map creation, data analysis, and data handling.
Most tools are based on R.

## Data

This folder has data what we used.
Note that big data (generally over the 100 MB) is divided into several parts.
Data for the figures in the paper has the same name with the figures.

For example, above figure shows visualized test cases generated for A1 by ADSWARM and the random testing approach (Figure 9 in the paper).
This raw data is placed in `data_10_guided_vs_random` folder.

## Fixes

This folder has fixes from what we found through our approach.
How to run is the same as the original ones.

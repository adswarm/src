# Code/Tools Developed 

This page contains code used in the paper including prototype, tools, data and fixes.

## Prototype

Prototype folder include the prototype of SwarmFlawFinder using A1.   
(Code including this prototype will be updated again. We are working on the interface.)

## Tools

This folder has tools what we used for preprocessing, map creation, data analysis, and data handling.
Most tools are based on R.

## Data

This folder has data what we used.
Note that big data (generally over the 100 MB) is divided into several parts.
Data for the figures in the paper has the same name with the figures.

For example, above figure shows visualized test cases generated for A1 by SwarmFlawFinder and the random testing approach (Figure 8 in the paper).
This raw data is placed in `data_10_guided_vs_random` folder.

## Fixes

This folder has fixes from what we found through our approach.
How to run is the same as the original ones.

# Tools used for the project

This page contains code used in the paper including prototype, tools, data and fixes.

## Prototype

Prototype folder include the prototype of ADSWARM using A1.

This folder has tools what we used for preprocessing, map creation, data analysis, and data handling.
Most of tools are based on R.

## Data

![](https://github.com/adswarm/src/blob/main/Source_code_tools_used/sample_data.png)

This folder has data what we used.
Note that big data (generally over the 100 MB) is divided into several parts but in case that data cannot be divided, we were not able to store here.

## Fixes

This folder has fixes from what we found through our approach.
How to run is the same as the original ones.

# FlawFinder vs Random Testing w.r.t 3 different searching subspace (Base, 2x Base, 3x Base)

Note that the base space area is the area what FlawFinder originally obtained natually.
Hence, applying searching space restrictions to FlawFinder does not make the results vary.
However, the random testing approach's performance varies significantly.

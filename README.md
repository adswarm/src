## SwarmFlawFinder: Discovering and Exploiting Logic Flaws of Swarm Algorithms

This is the project page for the submission "SwarmFlawFinder: Discovering and Exploiting Logic Flaws of Swarm Algorithms." 
Supplementary materials to the paper, not included due to the paper's space limit, can be found below.
Specifically, this repository includes all the developed tools, data, and results.

### 4. Algorithm Selection (for Evaluation)
- In **Section V. Evaluation; A. Experiment Setup (and Appendix A. Algorithm Selection)**, we refer to this webpage for the details of selection criteria of the algorithms we evaluated. 
  - Step 1: [The complete list of 73 algorithms we searched](https://github.com/adswarm/src/tree/main/Criteria_for_selecting_algorithms)
  - Step 2: [The list of algorithms we have tried but failed to run](https://github.com/adswarm/src/tree/main/failed_algo)
    - This page will provide the detail of why we were unable to run the algorithms and so include our studies.
  - Step 3: [The list of algorithm we have not choose to use](https://xxx)

### 5. [Evaluation of Fixes](https://github.com/adswarm/src/blob/main/eval_fixes)
- In **Section V. Evaluation; B. Effectiveness in Finding Logic Flaws**, we refer to this webpage for the quality and performance overhead of our suggested fixes.
  - This sub page includes 
    1. The quality of fixes 
    2. Performance overhead of the fixes and integrated fixes [Link](

### 6. [Spatial Distribution of Test-cases](https://github.com/adswarm/src/tree/main/Coverage_of_A3_and_A4_With_FLAWFINDER_and_Random)
- In **Section V. Evaluation; C. Effectiveness of DCC in Fuzz Testing**, we refer to this webpage for the spatial distribution of test-cases generated by algorithms A2, A3, and A4.

### 4. (Updated) Effectiveness of the naive testing

- To support the naive testing approach is less effective than FlawFinder (RA-Q4), this page shows the number of identified unique attacks from the random testing taking an example of A<sub>1</sub>.

Following folder contains this. **[Effectiveness_of_the_naive_testing](https://github.com/adswarm/src/tree/main/Effectiveness_of_the_naive_testing)**.

### (Updated) Comparison to randomized sampling

- To give supplementary information for RD-Q6 of rebuttal, this page explains that the instances on the top of the gray circle are variants of what FlawFinder already identified.

Following folder contains this. **[Comparison_to_randomized_sampling](https://github.com/adswarm/src/tree/main/Comparison_to_randomized_sampling)**.




### 999. Additional Materials
- We present additional materials that might be useful in understanding our work but are not referred to in the paper.
  - [Activated Attack Strategies during evaluation](https://github.com/adswarm/src/tree/main/attack_strategy_eval)
    - We report what attack strategies were frequently activated (might be effective) during testing for each algorithm.



### Detailed results for FlawFinder vs random search w.r.t search space

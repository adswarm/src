### 3. [Algorithm Selection (for Evaluation)](https://github.com/adswarm/src/tree/main/Criteria_for_selecting_algorithms)
- In **Section V. Evaluation; A. Experiment Setup (and Appendix A. Algorithm Selection)**, we refer to this webpage for the details of selection criteria of the algorithms we evaluated. 
  - [The complete list of 73 algorithms we searched](https://github.com/adswarm/src/tree/main/Criteria_for_selecting_algorithms)
    - [The list of algorithms we have tried but failed to run](https://github.com/adswarm/src/tree/main/failed_algo)
      - This page will provide the detail of why we were unable to run the algorithms and so include our studies.

### 4. [Evaluation of Fixes](https://github.com/adswarm/src/blob/main/eval_fixes)
- In **Section V. Evaluation; B. Effectiveness in Finding Logic Flaws**, we refer to this webpage for the quality and performance overhead of our suggested fixes.
  - This sub page includes 
    1. The quality of fixes for A2, A3, and A4 (A1 is in the paper)
    2. Performance overhead of the fixes and integrated fixes (for all algorithms)

### 5. [Spatial Distribution of Test-cases](https://github.com/adswarm/src/tree/main/Coverage_of_A3_and_A4_With_FLAWFINDER_and_Random)
- In **Section V. Evaluation; C. Effectiveness of DCC in Fuzz Testing**, we refer to this webpage for the spatial distribution of test-cases generated by algorithms A2, A3, and A4.

### 6. [FlawFinder and Random Testing Approach with Search Space Restrictions](https://github.com/adswarm/src/tree/main/flawfinder_vs_random_wrt_search_space)
- In **Section V. Evaluation; C. Effectiveness of DCC in Fuzz Testing; 3. Impact of Searching Space on Random Testing**, we refer to this webpage for the additional experiments of FlawFinder and the random testing approach with 3 different search space restrictions.
  - In the paper, we present 
  - This subpage provides additional results for FlawFinder under different search space restrictions.

### A. Additional Materials for Clarifications
- We present additional materials that might be useful in understanding our work but are not referred to in the paper.
  - **A.1. Statistics of Random Testing Approach and FlawFinder**
    - To support the random testing approach is less effective than FlawFinder (RA-Q4), this page shows the number of identified unique attacks from the random testing taking an example of A<sub>1</sub>.
    - [Link to open the subpage](https://github.com/adswarm/src/tree/main/Effectiveness_of_the_naive_testing)
  - **A.2. Analysis on Mission Failures Exclusively found by Random Testing Approach**
    - This page explains that the instances on the top of the gray circle are variants of what FlawFinder already identified.
    - [Link to open the subpage](https://github.com/adswarm/src/tree/main/Comparison_to_randomized_sampling)
  - **A.3. Activated Attack Strategies during Evaluation**
    - We report what attack strategies were frequently activated (might be effective) during testing for each algorithm.

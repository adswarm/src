The following figure illustrates the attack strategies (S<sub>1</sub> to S<sub>4</sub>) in Section 4A of the paper.

**Attack Strategy (S).** After an attack drone is spawned at P, it
detects the victim swarm and moves near the swarm. Then, it
conducts an attack based on the strategy S defined as follows
(**An illustration of the strategies is shown below**).
1. **Pushing Back (S<sub>1</sub>):** An attack drone tries to push back
a victim drone (i.e., against the victim drone’s flight
direction). In a swarm, this strategy typically delays the
progress of the swarm reaching the destination.
2. **Chasing (S<sub>2</sub>):** An attack drone closely follows a single
victim drone in a swarm. It typically causes a victim to
speed up, often making it difficult for the victim to control
itself from crashing into other objects.
3. **Dividing (S<sub>3</sub>):** An attack drone flies into the middle
of two victim drones to divide a group of drones into
smaller groups. It aims to disrupt the swarm’s collective
operation, making the swarm sparse or smaller sized.
4. **Herding (S<sub>4</sub>):** It aims to change the direction of an entire
swarm or the size of the swarm via attack drones pushing
victim drones from the outmost layer of the swarm.
